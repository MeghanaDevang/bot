Uploaded videos are the working of an automation bot that I created by following a course flow in Automation Anywhere platform.
It is a bot working for the company itbricks, where they collect information of the coustomers for a summer holiday pack.
So basically the bot reads the table information provided in the company website and fills the required entry in registeration form in another website to register the coustomers and sends the updated information of the registered coustomers through a mail to the manager.
